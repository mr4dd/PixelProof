# PixelProof firefox extension
-----
PixelProof is a firefox extension to block AI generated images that I made cause I just wanted a damn wallpaper and all I got was AI slop.
tldr, block AI images, fuck genAI.

**IMPORTANT**: for testing purposes i set the confidence score required for the extension to classify something as AI as 62%, that is way too low and its bc the pretrained model i was using to detect it is kinda bad (no offense) and i couldnt get higher readings, if you use another model you should definitely tweak that.

Let's be real I made this extension in like an hour (first time making an extension shut up), so the quality is pretty trash so if you can make any improvements to it (one that i can think of is intercepting the requests and modifying them before the image is even fetched) please do and open a PR, or fork it and make it your own i really dont care lol.

Made with hate by me.
