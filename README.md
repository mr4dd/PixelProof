# PixelProof firefox extension
-----
PixelProof is a firefox extension to block AI generated images that I made cause I just wanted a damn wallpaper and all I got was AI slop.
tldr, block AI images, fuck genAI.

Let's be real I made this extension in like an hour (first time making an extension shut up), so the quality is pretty trash so if you can make any improvements to it (one that i can think of is intercepting the requests and modifying them before the image is even fetched) please do and open a PR, or fork it and make it your own i really dont care lol.

Made with hate by me.
